## How you used N@tM to capture test data to be used in trimester 3 from feedback, something you will add to your project other?


We got multiple feedback from people of all backgrounds, the most valuable were from adults who were in the tech industry. Here are some of the data we collected  and what we are currently integrating in our project:

What looked good:
- backend to frontend connection
- SQL databases in backend updating in real time from frontend input, especially for the chat feature
- Controllers
- Really liked my Chat feature however they didn't like that it wasn't fully integrated with the login system

What we can add/improve on:
- Account, and setting classes --> integrate the clubs into the fetch that why users can put as many clubs as they want
- Compare --> Should search users by name
- Chat --> Should automatically update rather than requiring a refresh and should be integrated with the login system
- Styling
