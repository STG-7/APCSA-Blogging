# Overall Score

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/image.png">

Scoring 36/39 on my College Board CSA exam allows me to feel confident in my CompSci abilities. However, I recognize an area for improvement in my time management as I spent more time than optimal on certain tasks. This realization underscores the importance of refining my approach to ensure more efficient use of time during future exams. Despite this, I am confident in my computer science essential skills, and I believe with strategic time management adjustments, I can further enhance my overall performance in the future.

# Reflecting on Questions I Got Wrong

## Question 15 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/image-1.png">

### Code:
```
1:  public static void showMe(int arg) {
2:      if (arg < 10) {
3:          showMe(arg + 1);
4:      } else {
5:          System.out.print(arg + "");
6:      }
7:  }
```

### Correct Output:
```
012345678910
```

### Explanation of Code 
The method **showMe** takes an integer argument arg. If arg is **less than 10**, it calls itself recursively with arg + 1. This recursion continues until arg becomes 10 or greater, at which point the else block is executed, printing the current value of arg without a newline character.

The recursion will go from 0 to 10, printing each value in sequence without a newline. This results in the output: 012345678910.

### Reflection

The mistake might have occurred if you overlooked the recursive nature of the method and the fact that it prints each value before reaching the base case. It's crucial to understand the flow of the code, especially in recursive functions.


## Question 17

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/image-2.png">

### Code:
```
/* Precondition: num greater than 0 */
public static int doWhat(int num) {
    int var = 0;

    for (int loop = 1; loop <= num; loop = loop + 2) {
        var += loop;
    }

    return var;
}
```

### Correct Output + Explanation of Code:

For doWhat(1), the loop runs once with loop equal to 1, and the sum is 1.
For doWhat(5), the loop runs three times with loop equal to 1, 3, and 5, and the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
For doWhat(10), the loop runs five times with loop equal to 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, and the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25.

So, the output for the given method with different values of num would be:
- doWhat(1) returns 1.
- doWhat(5) returns 9.
- doWhat(10) returns 25.

### Reflection

This method takes an integer num as input and initializes a variable var to 0. It then iterates through a loop that starts from 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches or exceeds num. In each iteration, it adds the current value of loop to var. Finally, it returns the value of var. Therefore the correct answer is: D. "The sum of all odd integers between 1 and num, inclusive"
