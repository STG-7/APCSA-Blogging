# Overall Score

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/image.png">

Scoring 36/39 on my College Board CSA exam allows me to feel confident in my CompSci abilities. However, I recognize an area for improvement in my time management as I spent more time than optimal on certain tasks. This realization underscores the importance of refining my approach to ensure more efficient use of time during future exams. Despite this, I am confident in my computer science essential skills, and I believe with strategic time management adjustments, I can further enhance my overall performance in the future.

# Reflecting on Questions I Got Wrong

## Question 15 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/image-1.png">

### Code:
```
public static void showMe(int arg) {
      if (arg < 10) {
          showMe(arg + 1);
      } else {
          System.out.print(arg + "");
      }
  }
```

### Correct Output:
```
012345678910
```

### Explanation of Code 
The method **showMe** takes an integer argument arg. If arg is **less than 10**, it calls itself recursively with arg + 1. This recursion continues until arg becomes 10 or greater, at which point the else block is executed, printing the current value of arg without a newline character.

The recursion will go from 0 to 10, printing each value in sequence without a newline. This results in the output: 012345678910.

### Reflection

The mistake might have occurred if you overlooked the recursive nature of the method and the fact that it prints each value before reaching the base case. It's crucial to understand the flow of the code, especially in recursive functions.


## Question 17

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/image-2.png">

### Code:
```
/* Precondition: num greater than 0 */
public static int doWhat(int num) {
    int var = 0;

    for (int loop = 1; loop <= num; loop = loop + 2) {
        var += loop;
    }

    return var;
}
```

### Correct Output + Explanation of Code:

For doWhat(1), the loop runs once with loop equal to 1, and the sum is 1.
For doWhat(5), the loop runs three times with loop equal to 1, 3, and 5, and the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
For doWhat(10), the loop runs five times with loop equal to 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, and the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25.

So, the output for the given method with different values of num would be:
- doWhat(1) returns 1.
- doWhat(5) returns 9.
- doWhat(10) returns 25.

### Reflection

This method takes an integer num as input and initializes a variable var to 0. It then iterates through a loop that starts from 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches or exceeds num. In each iteration, it adds the current value of loop to var. Finally, it returns the value of var. Therefore the correct answer is: D. "The sum of all odd integers between 1 and num, inclusive"


## Question 18 Reflection

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/image-3.png">

### Code:
```
System.out.print(404 / 10 * 10 + 1);

```

### Correct Output:
```
401
```

### Explanation of Code 

1. Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

2. Division (/) and multiplication (*) have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right.

**Execution Steps:**

404 / 10: Division of 404 by 10 equals 40.
40 * 10: Multiplication of 40 by 10 equals 400.
400 + 1: Addition of 1 to 400 equals 401.

### Reflection

I may have overlooked the order of operations PEMDAS.

P: Parentheses/Brackets
E: Exponents/Orders
M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

## Question 33 Reflection

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/image-4.png">

### Code Segment I

```
 int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
 for (int value : arr) {
     if (max < value) {
         max = value;
     }
 }

```
This code initializes **max** to the minimum integer value and iterates through the array, updating max whenever a larger value is encountered. This code correctly finds the maximum element.

### Code Segment II
```
 int max = 0;
 boolean first = true;
 for (int value : arr) {
     if (first) {
         max = value;
         first = false;
     } else if (max < value) {
         max = value;
     }
}
```

This code also initializes max to 0 and uses a boolean flag **(first)** to handle the first iteration differently. It correctly finds the maximum element.


### Code Segment III
```
 int max = arr[0];
 for (int k = 1; k < arr.length; k++) {
     if (max < arr[k]) {
         max = arr[k];
     }
 }

```
This code initializes max to the first element of the array and iterates from the second element onward, updating max when a larger element is found. This code also correctly finds the maximum element.

### Conclusion

All three code segments correctly find the maximum element in the array, and any of them can be used for this purpose.

The correct response is:

E. I, II, and III

## Question 37 Reflection

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/image-5.png">

### Code Segment I

```
for (int k = startIndex; k < words.length; k++) {
     result += words[k] + words[words.length - k - 1];
 }

```
This code uses a for loop to iterate through the array, concatenating pairs of elements from the array in reverse order. It correctly concatenates the elements.

### Code Segment II
```
 int k = words.length - 1;
 while (k >= startIndex) {
     result += words[k];
     k--;
 }

```

This code initializes k to the last index of the array and uses a while loop to concatenate elements in reverse order. It correctly concatenates the elements.


### Code Segment III
```
String[] temp = new String[words.length];
for (int k = 0; k <= words.length / 2; k++) {
     temp[k] = words[words.length - k - 1];
     temp[words.length - k - 1] = words[k];
 }
 for (int k = 0; k < temp.length - startIndex; k++) {
     result += temp[k];
 }
```
This code creates a temporary array, swaps elements to reverse their order, and then concatenates elements starting from the startIndex. While it works, it's more complex than necessary for the given task.


### Conclusion

Both Code Segment I and Code Segment II correctly implement the logic needed for the concatWords method. Code Segment III, while functional, is more complicated and involves unnecessary steps.

The correct response is:

D. I and II
