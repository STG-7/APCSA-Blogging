    "a) Both person1 and person2 are references to objects of type Person.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Yes, person1 and person3 point to the same value in memory. When you assign person1 to person3 (`Person person3 = person1;`), you're not creating a new object, but rather making person3 refer to the same object as person1.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The integer \"number\" is stored in the stack. Primitive types like integers are typically stored in the stack memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) The value that \"person1\" points to (an instance of the Person class) is stored in the heap. Objects in Java are stored in the heap memory. So, person1 stores a reference to the actual object in the heap where the data for that person is stored."

    "(a) **Primitive Types vs Reference Types in Java:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primitive Types**: These are basic data types provided by Java, which are used to store simple values. Primitive types are not objects and are predefined by the language. They include `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, etc. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int num = 10;\n",
    "double price = 20.5;\n",
    "boolean isValid = true;\n",
    "char grade = 'A';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference Types**: Reference types refer to objects in Java. They store references (memory addresses) to objects rather than the actual objects themselves. Examples of reference types include classes, interfaces, arrays, etc. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String name = \"John Doe\";\n",
    "Customer customer = new Customer();\n",
    "ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **Differences between Primitive Types and Reference Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Allocation**:\n",
    "  - **Primitive Types**: Primitive types are allocated memory on the stack. The actual value is stored directly in memory.\n",
    "  - **Reference Types**: Reference types are allocated memory on the heap. The reference variable itself is stored on the stack, while the actual object is stored in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage**:\n",
    "  - **Primitive Types**: Primitive types hold the actual value. Operations performed on primitive types directly manipulate their values.\n",
    "  - **Reference Types**: Reference types hold references to objects. Operations performed on reference types often involve accessing and modifying the object's properties or calling its methods indirectly through the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) **Method Signature and Implementation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class InterestCalculator {\n",

    "\n",
    "Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
